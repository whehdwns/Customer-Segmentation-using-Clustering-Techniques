# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering-Techniques

Data Scource for this project is from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#"> UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>
- Data Set Information:
    - This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


This project aimed to segment customers of an e-commerce company based on their purchase history. The goal was to identify patterns and trends in the data that would allow the company to target specific groups of customers with personalized marketing campaigns. The project involved the following steps:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: The data was explored using various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of the data and identify patterns and trends.
- Clustering: K-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms were applied to the data to segment customers into different groups based on different criteria.
- Evaluation: The performance of the clustering algorithms was evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz index, Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient. Then, the best-performing algorithm was chosen.
- Results and Insights: The results of the clustering were analyzed to identify the characteristics of each customer segment, and insights were generated to inform the company's marketing strategy.
